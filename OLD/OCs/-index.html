					<p>kit is a small purple plushie, and a combination of a kitten, puppy, bunny, mouse- and even a slime! all in one!
					it has blue patches on its fabric, and a soft pink jelly stomach filled with different charms!
					its stuffing and blood are pearlescent blue, which can be seen if its fabric is ever torn or cut. luckily, being a plushie, the damage can simly be sewn up.
					kit wasn't always like this- but was experimented on in a lab. this also created its dark counterpart- who seems to only exist in its head.<br/>
					<br/>
					kit is used to represent our system as a whole, but is mostly the persona of hannah and hazel!</p>
